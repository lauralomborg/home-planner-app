# Claude Instructions for Home Planner App

## Git Workflow

- **Commit changes regularly** as work progresses to keep a clean history
- **NEVER push to main/master without explicit user permission** - always wait for confirmation that changes are working before pushing
- Only push when the user confirms the changes are tested and ready

## Project Context

This is a home floor plan editor with:
- 2D editor using Konva.js
- 3D visualization using React Three Fiber
- Nordic/Scandinavian design aesthetic
- Zustand state management with localStorage persistence

## Project Plan

The detailed plan for the app can be found at:
`/home-planner-app/Plan for Home Planner App .docx`

**Before building new features**, always verify that existing features work properly. Features should be tested and confirmed working before moving on to the next item in the plan.
